# Title: CleverPen

## Description

CleverPen is a Flask-based blogging platform integrated with OpenAI's GPT 3.5 model. Created during my early software development journey, this project provided a valuable learning experience. I gained proficiency in Flask, the Jinja templating engine, and integrating third-party APIs into applications.
